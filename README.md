# Motivation
As students often find it difficult to visualize complex data structures like linked lists, etc, and algorithms like backtracking, graph traversals, etc this project aims at helping the students understand the concepts in a much more visual way. Users can use this website to visualize data structures and algorithms for a better grasp and understanding of concepts. So far, this project contains the implementation of linked lists operations, backtracking, graph traversals, searching, and sorting algorithms. The technology stack used in the project is React along with CSS to improve the frontend design of the website and provide necessary animations required for the specific task. Class-based components are used to execute functions and perform specific operations when the user clicks on a component and render the appropriate response to the user actions. The website is deployed on the netlify platform where users with an internet connection can access the website to visualize algorithms of their choice.
